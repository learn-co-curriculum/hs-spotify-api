# Spotify's Chart API Todo

## Objective

Get more familiar with using APIs and their JSON contents in Ruby.

## Introduction

Scraping sites is one way to get data but many times, companies will expose more data through their application programming interfaces, or APIs. For this todo, we're going to focus on [Spotify's chart API](http://charts.spotify.com/docs).

## Instructions
* This is a test-driven lab so just get those specs to pass! Sorry the specs are a bit slow, in order to test this lab, we have to open and load the API sites twice, once in your code, once for the spec. 
* If you get stuck, refer to the [docs](http://charts.spotify.com/docs), the resources below, and take a look at these urls and try to pattern match: 
  * [http://charts.spotify.com/api/charts/]( http://charts.spotify.com/api/charts/)
  * [http://charts.spotify.com/api/charts/most_shared](http://charts.spotify.com/api/charts/most_shared)

## Extra Credit
* Make a command line app that interacts with the API.
